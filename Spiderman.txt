SEQ. 0100 - THE ALTERNATE SPIDER-MAN "TAS" WE BEGIN ON A COMIC.
The cover asks WHO IS SPIDER-MAN?
SPIDER-MAN (V.O.)
Alright, lets do this one last time. My name is Peter Parker.
QUICK CUTS of a BLOND PETER PARKER
Pulling down his mask...a name tag that reads "Peter Parker"...various shots of Spider-Man IN ACTION.
SPIDER-MAN (V.O.)
I was bitten by a radioactive spider and for ten years Ive been the one and only Spider-Man. Im pretty sure you know the rest.
UNCLE BEN tells Peter:
UNCLE BEN (V.O.)
With great power comes great responsibility.
Uncle Ben walks into the beyond.
SPIDER-MAN (V.O.)
I saved a bunch of people, fell in love, saved the city, and then I saved the city again and again and again...
Spiderman saves the city, kisses MJ, saves the city some more. The shots evoke ICONIC SPIDER-MAN IMAGES, but each one is subtly different, somehow altered.
SPIDER-MAN (V.O.)
And uh... I did this.
Cut to Spider-Man dancing on the street, exactly like in the movie Spider-Man 3.
SPIDER-MAN (V.O.)
We dont really talk about this.
A THREE PANEL SPLIT SCREEN: shots of Spider-Mans "products":
SPIDER-MAN (V.O.)
Look, Im a comic book, Im a cereal, did a Christmas album. I have an excellent theme song.
 (MORE)

 SPIDER-MAN (V.O.) (CONTD)
And a so-so popsicle. I mean, Ive looked worse.
MATCH CUT -- Peter, PINNED to a WALL by a mechanical tentacle arm. KINGPIN punches Peter. GREEN GOBLIN fights Peter.
SPIDER-MAN (V.O.)
But after everything, I still love
being Spider-Man. I mean, who wouldnt?
Peter runs toward a SUPER-COLLIDER, something well see quite soon. Peter SLAMMED TO THE GROUND.
SPIDER-MAN (V.O.)
So no matter how many hits I take, I always find a way to come back.
Peter GETS UP... in a shot that we will also remember, RIGHT BEFORE GOBLIN GRABS HIM.
The collider EXPLOLDING, the force of the blast rippling through New York.
SPIDER-MAN (V.O.)
Because the only thing standing between this city and oblivion is me. Theres only one Spider-Man. And youre looking at him.
Spider-Man WINKS. Man, hes cool.

SEQ. 0425 - SITTING BACK THERE "SBT" EXT. BROOKLYN - MORNING

been fine.
Reveal Jefferson driving. Miles dad is a COP!

 JEFFERSON
You can walk plenty on Saturday
when you peel those stickers off.
MILES
You saw that? I dont know if that
was me, Dad.
JEFFERSON
And the two from yesterday on
Clinton.
MILES Yeah. Those were me.
Jefferson stares, shuts down the cheekiness. Miles looks hurt. Jefferson clocks his pained look. It bums Jefferson out. Theres an awkwardness between Miles and his dad thats not there with his mom.
They drive by a row of HIPSTER COFFEE SHOPS. Jefferson tries to bridge the gap with Miles, more cheerful:
JEFFERSON
Soooo... look at that, another new
coffee shop... you see that Miles?
MILES Totally, yeah...

--You see that one, whats that one

MILES (CONTD) I see it--
JEFFERSON
Is that a coffee shop or a disco?
MILES
Dad, youre old, man.
NEWS ANCHOR (ON RADIO) There are multiple reports of
another mysterious seismic event last night. Sources close to Spider- Man say he is looking into the problem.

 Jefferson shakes his head, disapproving, turns off the radio.
JEFFERSON
Spider-Man. I mean this guy swings
in once a day zip zap zop in his little mask and answers to no one, right?
MILES Yeah, Dad.
JEFFERSON
And meanwhile my guys are out
there, lives on the line--
MILES (CONTD) Uh huh...
SCHOOL KIDS run alongside the car looking at Miles, who slinks down. They bang on the window, teasing Miles, "you get arrested?!"
JEFFERSON --no masks, we show our
faces. Accountability.
MILES (CONTD) --Oh no! Dad, speed up, I
know these kids--
JEFFERSON
--You know, with great ability
comes great accountability--
MILES
Thats not even how the saying
goes, Dad--
JEFFERSON
--I do like his cereal though, Ill
give him that--
Jeff stops the car. The teens reach Miles window.
TEEN BOY
Yo Miles! You get arrested?
MILES (mortified)
--Oh my gosh. Dont cops run red lights?
JEFFERSON
Some do... but not your Dad!

The car drives up right under the Brooklyn Bridge, to a school overlooking MANHATTAN, which LOOMS across the water.
7.

 EXT. VISIONS ACADEMY - MORNING
The car pulls up. Miles sits, not wanting to go in.
MILES
Why cant I go back to Brooklyn
Middle?
JEFFERSON (raises his eyebrows)
Miles, youve given it two weeks. Were not having this conversation.
MILES
--I just think that this new school
is elitist--
JEFFERSON --Elitist?--
MILES
--and I would prefer to be at a
normal school among the people. JEFFERSON
The people? These are your people!
MILES
--Im only here 'cause I won that
stupid lottery--
JEFFERSON
No way. You passed the entry test
just like everybody else, ok! You have an opportunity here, you wanna blow that, huh? You want to end up like your Uncle?
MILES (under his breath)
--Whats wrong with Uncle Aaron? Hes a good guy--
--Jefferson FLINCHES, angered. Reins it in.
JEFFERSON
...We all make choices in life--
MILES
--It doesnt feel like I have a
choice right now--
JEFFERSON --YOU DONT!

 Tension fills the car. They sit in silence for a beat.
Miles gets out of the car and opens the front door to get his bag Jefferson staring through his rearview mirror--
JEFFERSON (CONTD) I love you, Miles.
MILES
Yeah, I know, Dad. See you Friday--
--Miles shuts the door and walks away. Jefferson watches, bummed at the state of the relationship. He lifts his P.A.
JEFFERSON (INTO P.A.) You gotta say I love you back.
MILES Dad are you serious?
JEFFERSON (CONTD) I wanna hear it.
JEFFERSON (CONTD) --I love you, Dad.
