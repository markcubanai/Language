    "1. Open another browser tab and navigate to https://portal.azure.com.\n",

    "1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to https://www.luis.ai/.\n",
    "2. Sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription. If this is the first time you have signed into LUIS, you may need to grant the app some permissions to access your account details, and then fill in some information and accept the terms of use.\n",

    "### Train and Publish the Model\n",
    "1. At the top of the page, click **Train** to train the AI model.\n",

    "    * *turn on the light* should predict **Light On**\n",
