      "source": "## Using the Language Understanding Intelligence Service (LUIS)\nIncreasingly, we expect computers to be able to use AI in order to understand spoken or typed commands in natural language. For example, we want to be able to say \"switch on the light\" or \"put the light on\", and have an AI-powered device understand the command and take appropriate action.\n\n### Provision the Language Understanding Intelligence Service (LUIS)\nThe Microsoft cognitive services include the Language Understanding Intelligence Service (LUIS), which enables you to define *intents* that are applied to *entities* based on *utterances*.\n\nTo get started with LUIS, follow these steps to provision the service in your Azure subscription:\n1. Open another browser tab and navigate to https://portal.azure.com.\n2. Sign in using your Microsoft account.\n3. Click **+ Create a resource**, and search for **Language Understanding**.\n4. In the list of services, click **Language Understanding**.\n5. In the **Language Understanding** blade, click **Create**.\n6. In the **Create** blade, enter the following details, and then click **Review + create**\n  * **Create Options**: Both\n  * **Subscription**: Azure for Students\n  * **Resource Group**: Choose the existing resource group you used previously.\n  * **Name**: A unique name for your service.\n  * **Authoring location**: Choose a recommended location.\n  * **Authoring pricing tier**: Choose the F0 pricing tier.\n  * **Prediction location**: Choose a recommended location.\n  * **Prediction pricing tier**: Choose the F0 pricing tier.\n7. Click **Create**\n8. Wait for the service to be created.\n\n### Create a LUIS App\nTo implement natural language understanding with LUIS, you must first create an app; and then add intents, utterances, and entities to define the commands you want the app to understand.\n1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to https://www.luis.ai/.\n2. Sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription. If this is the first time you have signed into LUIS, you may need to grant the app some permissions to access your account details, and then fill in some information and accept the terms of use.\n3. If a message prompting you to complete a tutorial, close it (you can complete this tutorial later - for now, we'll focus on a simpler example).\n4. Click **Create new app** and create a new app with the following settings:\n  * **Name**: Simple Home Automation\n  * **Culture**: English\n  * **Description**: A basic home automation example\n5. If an instructional window opens, close out of it.\n\n\n### Create Intents\n1. Click on the **Build** tab in the top menu.\n2. In the pane on the left, click **Intents**. Then click **+ Create new intent**, and add an intent with the name **Light On**. Intents are **case sensitive** so enter the name exactly as it appears!\n3. In the field that says \"Enter an example of what user might say and hit Enter.\", type \"*switch the light on*\" and press **Enter** to add this utterance to the list.\n4. Next, hover your mouse over the word \"light\" in the newly created utterance so that the list shows the value *switch the [light] on*. Then click **[light]**,  type *Light*, and click **Create a new entity** and create a *simple* entity named **Light**.\n5. In the pane on the left, click **Intents** and click **+ Create new intent**, to add a second intent with the name **Light Off**. Intents are **case sensitive** so enter the name exactly as it appears!\n6. In the field that says \"Enter an example of what user might say and hit Enter.\", type \"*switch the light off*\" and press **Enter** to add this utterance to the list.\n7. In the list of utterances, in the *switch the light off* utterance, hold the mouse over the word \"light\" so that the list shows the value *switch the [light] off*. Then click **[light]** select the *Light* entity you created previously.\n\n### Train the Model\n1. At the top of the page, click **Train** to train the AI model.\n2. After the app has been trained, click **Test**, and then in the test pane, enter the following utterances and verify that for each utterance, the correct intent is predicted underneath the text bubble:\n    * *turn on the light* should predict **Light On**\n    * *put the light off* should predict **Light Off**\n3. At the top of the page, click **Publish**. Then ensure that the **Production** option is selected and click **Publish**.\n4. Once the app has been published, click **Refer to the list of endpoints** in the success banner at the top of the screen.\n\n### Consume the LUIS App\nNow that you have published your LUIS app, you can consume it from a client application by making HTTP requests that include a query string. The query will be used to identify the most likely intent, which will be returned to the calling client as in JSON response.\n\nAssign the **exampleQuery** variable in the cell below to reflect the Example Query URL for your app. Then **run the cell**, and enter a command when prompted to call your service and interpret the command. The JSON response is shown with an appropriate image for each command.\n\nTry the following commands:\n* *Switch on the light*\n* *Turn on the light*\n* *Turn off the light*\n* *Could you put the light on please?*"
