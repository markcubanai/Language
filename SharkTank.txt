Hi sharks, my name is Tommy Prestella and I'm an Air Force pilot from San Dimas, California. I'm here today seeking one hundred thousand dollars for twenty five percent of my company. Now sharks, I love summer days as much as the next guy. What's not to love, right? I mean backyard barbeques, evening baseball games...I love it all. But sharks, there's one thing about Summer that I just really don't like. It's freakin' hot! And if you've been stationed in the deep south like I have for the past twelve years, or deployed overseas to Iraq, Afghanistan, or Africa, you know that those places get crazy hot! I got sick and tired of sweating through my clothes everytime I stepped outside and just always being uncomfortable. So I fused together a creative way to stay cool and beat the summer heat. Sharks, you guys ready to cool off? Introducing the one and only Pick-up Pools. Sharks, as you can see the Pick-up Pool is the ultimate truck bed swimming pool. This patented pool liner instantly transforms the bed of your pickup truck into an above-ground pool. Simply pull the corners of the Pick-up Pool over the corners of your truck bed, add water, and bam you're ready for a pool party. When you're done there's a drain at the back, you can drain the water without lowering your towgear. Now sharks, the Pick-up Pool is a brand new product in an untapped market. So what do you say? Who wants to go for a swim and make a deal with Pick-up Pool?
